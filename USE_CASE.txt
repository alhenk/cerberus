Cerberus

USE CASE: Description
A door is closed and locked.
An employee applys a card to Cerberus on the door.
The Cerberus reads the card's UID with a cardreader and checks it in a database.
If the UID is valid then Cerberus unlocks the door, sets a 30s timer up and makes a record to the database.
If the door is open beyond the 30s interval after Cerberus has unlocked it then Cerberus raises an alarm and makes a record to the database.
